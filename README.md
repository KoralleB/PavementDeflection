# Pavement Deflection Shiny App

This app visualizes the deflection bowls of a pavement, as measured at five stations under four different load levels.
The user can choose the station (radio button), the load level (radio button), the load cycle (slider), and the load repetition (same slider).

The modeled pavement is a test track constructed at the testing site of the University of California Pavement Research Center (UCPRC).
The load was applied by Heavy Vehicle Simulator (see bottom pictue) for a couple of thousands cycles, where each cycle was repeated up to three times.
The testing conitunued for one month, where the deflection data was collected by transducers. 
Overall, over 1.5 million rows of data was collected and analyzed for the app.

The app was created as part of my thesis work, where I modeled recycled pavement performance based on the deflection depth.
Visual investigation of the deflection bowls was a necessary step in the data cleaning. Therefore, I created this app, as an interactive visualizaion tool. The app quickly processed big data, and provided quick navigation between the different load stations and levels.
