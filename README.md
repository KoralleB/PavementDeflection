# Pavement Deflection Shiny App

The app visualizes the deflection bowls of a pavement, as measured at five stations under four different load levels.

The user can choose the station (radio button), the load level (radio button), the load cycle (slider), and the load repetition (same slider).

## Background

The modeled pavement is a test track constructed at the testing site of the University of California Pavement Research Center (UCPRC).

The load was applied by a Heavy Vehicle Simulator (see bottom picture) for a couple of thousands of cycles, where each cycle was repeated up to three times.

The testing continued for about a month, where the deflection data was collected by transducers installed under the surface layer of the pavement.

Overall, over 1.5 million rows of data were collected and analyzed for the app.


The app was created as part of my thesis work, where I modeled recycled pavement performance based on deflection depth.

Visual investigation of the deflection bowls was a necessary step in the data cleaning. Therefore, I created this app, as an interactive visualization tool. The app quickly processed big data, and provided convenient navigation between the different load stations and levels (in contrast to MATLAB individual visualization capabilities).
